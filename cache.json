However, previous\nattempts still struggle with stochastic inference, conflicting with the\ndeterministic nature of the Image2Normal task, and costly ensembling step,\nwhich slows down the estimation process. Our method, StableNormal, mitigates\nthe stochasticity of the diffusion process by reducing inference variance, thus\nproducing \"Stable-and-Sharp\" normal estimates without any additional ensembling\nprocess. StableNormal works robustly under challenging imaging conditions, such\nas extreme lighting, blurring, and low quality. It is also robust against\ntransparent and reflective surfaces, as well as cluttered scenes with numerous\nobjects. Specifically, StableNormal employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, which\nstarts with a one-step normal estimator (YOSO) to derive an initial normal\nguess, that is relatively coarse but reliable, then followed by a\nsemantic-guided refinement process (SG-DRN) that refines the normals to recover\ngeometric details. The effectiveness of StableNormal is demonstrated through\ncompetitive performance in standard datasets such as DIODE-indoor, iBims,\nScannetV2 and NYUv2, and also in various downstream tasks, such as surface\nreconstruction and normal enhancement. These results evidence that StableNormal\nretains both the \"stability\" and \"sharpness\" for accurate normal estimation.\nStableNormal represents a baby attempt to repurpose diffusion priors for\ndeterministic estimation.

While numerous deep learning approaches have been developed to\nlearn molecular representations under these constraints, most of them are built\nupon heuristic and costly modules. We argue that there is a strong need for a\ngeneral and flexible framework for learning both invariant and equivariant\nfeatures. In this work, we introduce a novel Transformer-based molecular model\ncalled GeoMFormer to achieve this goal. Using the standard Transformer modules,\ntwo separate streams are developed to maintain and learn invariant and\nequivariant representations. Carefully designed cross-attention modules bridge\nthe two streams, allowing information fusion and enhancing geometric modeling\nin each stream. As a general and flexible architecture, we show that many\nprevious architectures can be viewed as special instantiations of GeoMFormer.\nExtensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the power of GeoMFormer.

Several methods\nuse machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space,\nconditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of\natomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering\nthe structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly\nconsider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the\nligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free\nenergy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial\nmetrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand\nand protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity\nDiffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance\nmethod to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand\nbinding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between\nligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to\nmodel the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina\n(ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity\nbased on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By\nusing a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient\nof our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained\ndiffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of\ngenerated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\\%, significantly\nsurpassing previous machine learning methods.

We train VideoScore (initialized from Mantis)\nbased on VideoFeedback to enable automatic video quality assessment.\nExperiments show that the Spearman correlation between VideoScore and humans\ncan reach 77.1 on VideoFeedback-test, beating the prior best metrics by about\n50 points. Further result on other held-out EvalCrafter, GenAI-Bench, and\nVBench show that VideoScore has consistently much higher correlation with human\njudges than other metrics. Due to these results, we believe VideoScore can\nserve as a great proxy for human raters to (1) rate different video models to\ntrack progress (2) simulate fine-grained human feedback in Reinforcement\nLearning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve current video generation models.\n","authors":["Xuan He","Dongfu Jiang","Ge Zhang","Max Ku","Achint Soni","Sherman Siu","Haonan Chen","Abhranil Chandra","Ziyan Jiang","Aaran Arulraj","Kai Wang","Quy Duc Do","Yuansheng Ni","Bohan Lyu","Yaswanth Narsupalli","Rongqi Fan","Zhiheng Lyu","Yuchen Lin","Wenhu Chen"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15252v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17012v3","updated":"2024-06-24T16:18:45Z","published":"2024-02-26T20:41:50Z","title":"Pandora's White-Box: Precise Training Data Detection and Extraction in\n  Large Language Models","summary":"  In this paper we develop state-of-the-art privacy attacks against Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), where an adversary with some access to the model tries\nto learn something about the underlying training data.

The review shows that few-shot learning can\novercome data scarcity in most outcomes and that meta-learning is a popular\nchoice to perform few-shot learning because it can adapt to new tasks with few\nlabelled samples. In addition, following meta-learning, supervised learning and\nsemi-supervised learning stand out as the predominant techniques employed to\ntackle few-shot learning challenges in medical imaging and also best\nperforming. Lastly, we observed that the primary application areas\npredominantly encompass cardiac, pulmonary, and abdominal domains.

As AI decisions\nbecome inescapable, entering domains such as healthcare, education, and law, we\nmust confront a vital question: how can we ensure AI systems have the\nlegitimacy necessary for effective governance? This essay argues that to secure\nAI legitimacy, we need methods that engage the public in designing and\nconstraining AI systems, ensuring these technologies reflect the community's\nshared values. Constitutional AI, proposed by Anthropic, represents a step\ntowards this goal, offering a model for democratic control of AI. However,\nwhile Constitutional AI's commitment to hardcoding explicit principles into AI\nmodels enhances transparency and accountability, it falls short in two crucial\naspects: addressing the opacity of individual AI decisions and fostering\ngenuine democratic legitimacy. To overcome these limitations, this essay\nproposes \"Public Constitutional AI.\" This approach envisions a participatory\nprocess where diverse stakeholders, including ordinary citizens, deliberate on\nthe principles guiding AI development. The resulting \"AI Constitution\" would\ncarry the legitimacy of popular authorship, grounding AI governance in the\npublic will. Furthermore, the essay proposes \"AI Courts\" to develop \"AI case\nlaw,\" providing concrete examples for operationalizing constitutional\nprinciples in AI training. This evolving combination of constitutional\nprinciples and case law aims to make AI governance more responsive to public\nvalues.

Whether or not a specific\nsequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only\ndepends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates\nfrom what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly\nshuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model\ntemporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural\nnetworks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step\napproach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in\ntime series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with\n(ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn\ngraph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method\nleverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within\nboth first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal\nordering of events.

We evaluate our approach for static node classification using\nbenchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to\nincorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented\ntemporal edges.

In this paper, a novel\nframework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight\ntrajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the\nlimitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT\nframework.

Embedding and mapping, as a classic\ncross-domain research genre, aims to identify a common mapping function to\nperform representation transformation between two domains. Nevertheless,\nprevious coarse-grained preference representations, non-personalized mapping\nfunctions, and excessive reliance on overlapping users limit their performance,\nespecially in scenarios where overlapping users are sparse. To address\naforementioned challenges, we propose a novel cross-domain approach, namely\nCVPM. CVPM formalizes cross-domain interest transfer as a hybrid architecture\nof parametric meta-learning and self-supervised learning, which not only\ntransfers user preferences at a finer level, but also enables signal\nenhancement with the knowledge of non-overlapping users. Specifically, with\ndeep insights into user preferences and valence preference theory, we believe\nthat there exists significant difference between users' positive preferences\nand negative behaviors, and thus employ differentiated encoders to learn their\ndistributions. In particular, we further utilize the pre-trained model and item\npopularity to sample pseudo-interaction items to ensure the integrity of both\ndistributions. To guarantee the personalization of preference transfer, we\ntreat each user's mapping as two parts, the common transformation and the\npersonalized bias, where the network used to generate the personalized bias is\noutput by a meta-learner. Furthermore, in addition to the supervised loss for\noverlapping users, we design contrastive tasks for non-overlapping users from\nboth group and individual-levels to avoid model skew and enhance the semantics\nof representations.

However, the recent shift towards\nnon-stationary data modeling has highlighted the limitations of this heuristic,\nexposing that its adaptation capabilities are far from those seen in biological\nbrains. Unlike BP, where weight updates are computed through a reverse error\npropagation path, Hebbian learning dynamics provide synaptic updates using only\ninformation within the layer itself. This has spurred interest in biologically\nplausible learning algorithms, hypothesized to overcome BP's shortcomings. In\nthis context, Hinton recently introduced the Forward-Forward Algorithm (FFA),\nwhich employs local learning rules for each layer and has empirically proven\nits efficacy in multiple data modeling tasks. In this work we argue that when\nemploying a squared Euclidean norm as a goodness function driving the local\nlearning, the resulting FFA is equivalent to a neo-Hebbian Learning Rule. To\nverify this result, we compare the training behavior of FFA in analog networks\nwith its Hebbian adaptation in spiking neural networks. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that both versions of FFA produce similar accuracy and latent\ndistributions. The findings herein reported provide empirical evidence linking\nbiological learning rules with currently used training algorithms, thus paving\nthe way towards extrapolating the positive outcomes from FFA to Hebbian\nlearning rules.

Hence in this paper, we make one of the first\nattempts to propose a Frequency-Aware Prompting method with mutual attention\nfor Cross-Domain Few-Shot classification, which can let networks simulate the\nhuman visual perception of selecting different frequency cues when facing new\nrecognition tasks. Specifically, a frequency-aware prompting mechanism is first\nproposed, in which high-frequency components of the decomposed source image are\nswitched either with normal distribution sampling or zeroing to get\nfrequency-aware augment samples. Then, a mutual attention module is designed to\nlearn generalizable inductive bias under CD-FSL settings.

To this end, we\npropose the Approximate Backpropagation (Approx-BP) theory, which provides the\ntheoretical feasibility of decoupling the forward and backward passes. We apply\nour Approx-BP theory to backpropagation training and derive memory-efficient\nalternatives of GELU and SiLU activation functions, which use derivative\nfunctions of ReLUs in the backward pass while keeping their forward pass\nunchanged. In addition, we introduce a Memory-Sharing Backpropagation strategy,\nwhich enables the activation memory to be shared by two adjacent layers,\nthereby removing activation memory usage redundancy. Our method neither induces\nextra computation nor reduces training efficiency.

In this\npaper, we focus on adapting and empowering a pure large language model for\nzero-shot and few-shot recommendation tasks. First and foremost, we identify\nand formulate the lifelong sequential behavior incomprehension problem for LLMs\nin recommendation domains, i.e., LLMs fail to extract useful information from a\ntextual context of long user behavior sequence, even if the length of context\nis far from reaching the context limitation of LLMs. To address such an issue\nand improve the recommendation performance of LLMs, we propose a novel\nframework, namely Retrieval-enhanced Large Language models (ReLLa) for\nrecommendation tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings. For zero-shot\nrecommendation, we perform semantic user behavior retrieval (SUBR) to improve\nthe data quality of testing samples, which greatly reduces the difficulty for\nLLMs to extract the essential knowledge from user behavior sequences. As for\nfew-shot recommendation, we further design retrieval-enhanced instruction\ntuning (ReiT) by adopting SUBR as a data augmentation technique for training\nsamples. Specifically, we develop a mixed training dataset consisting of both\nthe original data samples and their retrieval-enhanced counterparts. We conduct\nextensive experiments on three real-world public datasets to demonstrate the\nsuperiority of ReLLa compared with existing baseline models, as well as its\ncapability for lifelong sequential behavior comprehension. To be highlighted,\nwith only less than 10% training samples, few-shot ReLLa can outperform\ntraditional CTR models that are trained on the entire training set (e.g.,\nDCNv2, DIN, SIM).

The primary challenges in producing longer videos include\nthe substantial memory requirements and the extended processing time required\non a single GPU. A straightforward solution would be to split the workload\nacross multiple GPUs, which, however, leads to two issues: (1) ensuring all\nGPUs communicate effectively to share timing and context information, and (2)\nmodifying existing video diffusion models, which are usually trained on short\nsequences, to create longer videos without additional training.

We also\nprovide experimental evidence that not only shows that reward DDTs can often\nachieve competitive RL performance when compared with larger capacity deep\nneural network reward functions but also demonstrates the diagnostic utility of\nour framework in checking alignment of learned reward functions. We also\nobserve that the choice between soft and hard (argmax) output of reward DDT\nreveals a tension between wanting highly shaped rewards to ensure good RL\nperformance, while also wanting simpler, more interpretable rewards.

Recent works leverage text\ninstructions to allow users to more freely express their search intents.\nHowever, they primarily focus on image pairs that are visually similar and/or\ncan be characterized by a small set of pre-defined relations. The core thesis\nof this paper is that text instructions can enable retrieving images with\nricher relations beyond visual similarity. To show this, we introduce\nMagicLens, a series of self-supervised image retrieval models that support\nopen-ended instructions. MagicLens is built on a key novel insight: image pairs\nthat naturally occur on the same web pages contain a wide range of implicit\nrelations (e.g., inside view of), and we can bring those implicit relations\nexplicit by synthesizing instructions via foundation models. Trained on 36.7M\n(query image, instruction, target image) triplets with rich semantic relations\nmined from the web, MagicLens achieves results comparable with or better than\nprior best on eight benchmarks of various image retrieval tasks, while\nmaintaining high parameter efficiency with a significantly smaller model size.\nAdditional human analyses on a 1.4M-image unseen corpus further demonstrate the\ndiversity of search intents supported by MagicLens.

We propose\nSphere Neural Networks (SphNNs) for human-like reasoning through model\nconstruction and inspection, and develop SphNN for syllogistic reasoning, a\nmicrocosm of human rationality. SphNN is a hierarchical neuro-symbolic\nKolmogorov-Arnold geometric GNN, and uses a neuro-symbolic transition map of\nneighbourhood spatial relations to transform the current sphere configuration\ntowards the target. SphNN is the first neural model that can determine the\nvalidity of long-chained syllogistic reasoning in one epoch without training\ndata, with the worst computational complexity of O(N). SphNN can evolve into\nvarious types of reasoning, such as spatio-temporal reasoning, logical\nreasoning with negation and disjunction, event reasoning, neuro-symbolic\nunification, and humour understanding (the highest level of cognition). All\nthese suggest a new kind of Herbert A. Simon's scissors with two neural blades.\nSphNNs will tremendously enhance interdisciplinary collaborations to develop\nthe two neural blades and realise deterministic neural reasoning and\nhuman-bounded rationality and elevate LLMs to reliable psychological AI. This\nwork suggests that the non-zero radii of spheres are the missing components\nthat prevent traditional deep-learning systems from reaching the realm of\nrational reasoning and cause LLMs to be trapped in the swamp of hallucination.\n","authors":["Tiansi Dong","Mateja Jamnik","Pietro Li√≤"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15297v3.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10561v3","updated":"2024-06-24T19:43:21Z","published":"2023-12-16T23:31:20Z","title":"Enabling Accelerators for Graph Computing","summary":"  The advent of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has revolutionized the field of\nmachine learning, offering a novel paradigm for learning on graph-structured\ndata.

The simultaneous\noptimization of the entire parameter set, including the coefficients of a\npredefined distortion model, may result in poor distortion correction at the\nimage boundaries or in miscalculation of the intrinsic parameters, even with a\nreasonably small reprojection error. Indeed, applications involving image\nstitching (e.g. multi-camera systems) require accurate mapping of distortion up\nto the outermost regions of the image.

Previous text-based methods for generating 3D heads\nwere limited by text descriptions and image-based methods struggled to produce\nhigh-quality head geometry. To handle this challenging problem, we propose a\nnovel framework, Portrait3D, to generate high-quality 3D heads while preserving\ntheir identities. Our work incorporates the identity information of the\nportrait image into three parts: 1) geometry initialization, 2) geometry\nsculpting, and 3) texture generation stages. Given a reference portrait image,\nwe first align the identity features with text features to realize ID-aware\nguidance enhancement, which contains the control signals representing the face\ninformation. We then use the canny map, ID features of the portrait image, and\na pre-trained text-to-normal/depth diffusion model to generate ID-aware\ngeometry supervision, and 3D-GAN inversion is employed to generate ID-aware\ngeometry initialization. Furthermore, with the ability to inject identity\ninformation into 3D head generation, we use ID-aware guidance to calculate\nID-aware Score Distillation (ISD) for geometry sculpting. For texture\ngeneration, we adopt the ID Consistent Texture Inpainting and Refinement which\nprogressively expands the view for texture inpainting to obtain an\ninitialization UV texture map.

In contrast to conventional box-supervised\nsegmentation, where the box edges must precisely touch the target boundaries,\nMonoBox leverages imprecisely-annotated boxes to achieve robust pixel-wise\nsegmentation. The 'linchpin' is that, within the noisy zones around box edges,\nMonoBox discards the traditional misguiding multiple-instance learning loss,\nand instead optimizes a carefully-designed objective, termed monotonicity\nconstraint. Along directions transitioning from the foreground to background,\nthis new constraint steers responses to adhere to a trend of monotonically\ndecreasing values. Consequently, the originally unreliable learning within the\nnoisy zones is transformed into a correct and effective monotonicity\noptimization. Moreover, an adaptive label correction is introduced, enabling\nMonoBox to enhance the tightness of box annotations using predicted masks from\nthe previous epoch and dynamically shrink the noisy zones as training\nprogresses. We verify MonoBox in the box-supervised segmentation task of\npolyps, where satisfying box-tightness is challenging due to the vague\nboundaries between the polyp and normal tissues.

Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged as\na promising technique to gradually adapt a source-trained model to test data\ndrawn from a continually changing target domain. Despite recent advancements in\naddressing CTTA, two critical issues remain: 1) The use of a fixed threshold\nfor pseudo-labeling in existing methodologies leads to the generation of\nlow-quality pseudo-labels, as model confidence varies across categories and\ndomains; 2) While current solutions utilize stochastic parameter restoration to\nmitigate catastrophic forgetting, their capacity to preserve critical\ninformation is undermined by its intrinsic randomness. To tackle these\nchallenges, we present CTAOD, aiming to enhance the performance of detection\nmodels in CTTA scenarios. Inspired by prior CTTA works for effective\nadaptation, CTAOD is founded on the mean-teacher framework, characterized by\nthree core components. Firstly, the object-level contrastive learning module\ntailored for object detection extracts object-level features using the\nteacher's region of interest features and optimizes them through contrastive\nlearning. Secondly, the dynamic threshold strategy updates the\ncategory-specific threshold based on predicted confidence scores to improve the\nquality of pseudo-labels. Lastly, we design a data-driven stochastic\nrestoration mechanism to selectively reset inactive parameters using the\ngradients as weights for a random mask matrix, thereby ensuring the retention\nof essential knowledge.

The performance of triplet-based deep metric learning is contingent upon\nidentifying the best threshold for triplet loss. Threshold validation, however,\nis tough and challenging, as the ideal threshold changes among datasets and\neven across classes within the same dataset. In this paper, we present the\nmulti-threshold deep metric learning technique, which not only avoids the\ndifficult threshold validation but also vastly increases the capacity of\ntriplet loss learning to construct expression feature representations. We find\nthat each threshold of the triplet loss intrinsically determines a distinctive\ndistribution of inter-class variations and corresponds, thus, to a unique\nexpression feature representation. Therefore, rather than selecting a single\noptimal threshold from a valid threshold range, we thoroughly sample thresholds\nacross the range, allowing the representation characteristics manifested by\nthresholds within the range to be fully extracted and leveraged for FER. To\nrealize this approach, we partition the embedding layer of the deep metric\nlearning network into a collection of slices and model training these embedding\nslices as an end-to-end multi-threshold deep metric learning problem. Each\nembedding slice corresponds to a sample threshold and is learned by enforcing\nthe corresponding triplet loss, yielding a set of distinct expression features,\none for each embedding slice. It makes the embedding layer, which is composed\nof a set of slices, a more informative and discriminative feature, hence\nenhancing the FER accuracy.

A straightforward solution would be to split the workload\nacross multiple GPUs, which, however, leads to two issues: (1) ensuring all\nGPUs communicate effectively to share timing and context information, and (2)\nmodifying existing video diffusion models, which are usually trained on short\nsequences, to create longer videos without additional training.

In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires\nan extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational\nbottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late\ntime horizon is required.

Several methods\nuse machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space,\nconditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion\nmodels have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of\natomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering\nthe structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly\nconsider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the\nligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free\nenergy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial\nmetrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand\nand protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity\nDiffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement.

Although\ndiffusion models have excelled at capturing data distributions, they still\nsuffer from various limitations such as slow convergence, mode-collapse on\nimbalanced data, and lack of diversity. These issues are partially linked to\nthe use of light-tailed Brownian motion (BM) with independent increments. In\nthis paper, we replace BM with an approximation of its non-Markovian\ncounterpart, fractional Brownian motion (fBM), characterized by correlated\nincrements and Hurst index $H \\in (0,1)$, where $H=1/2$ recovers the classical\nBM. To ensure tractable inference and learning, we employ a recently\npopularized Markov approximation of fBM (MA-fBM) and derive its reverse time\nmodel, resulting in generative fractional diffusion models (GFDMs). We\ncharacterize the forward dynamics using a continuous reparameterization trick\nand propose an augmented score matching loss to efficiently learn the\nscore-function, which is partly known in closed form, at minimal added cost.\nThe ability to drive our diffusion model via fBM provides flexibility and\ncontrol. $H \\leq 1/2$ enters the regime of rough paths whereas $H>1/2$\nregularizes diffusion paths and invokes long-term memory as well as a\nheavy-tailed behaviour (super-diffusion).

To prevent the forgetting of\npre-trained knowledge, RLHF usually incorporates a KL regularization; this\nforces the policy to remain close to its supervised fine-tuned initialization,\nthough it hinders the reward optimization. To tackle the trade-off between KL\nand reward, in this paper we introduce a novel alignment strategy named Weight\nAveraged Rewarded Policies (WARP). WARP merges policies in the weight space at\nthree distinct stages. First, it uses the exponential moving average of the\npolicy as a dynamic anchor in the KL regularization. Second, it applies\nspherical interpolation to merge independently fine-tuned policies into a new\nenhanced one.

This paper explores the\nuse of machine learning techniques to help navigate the systematic review\nprocess. ML has previously been used to reliably 'screen' articles for review -\nthat is, identify relevant articles based on reviewers' inclusion criteria. The\napplication of ML techniques to subsequent stages of a review, however, such as\ndata extraction and evidence mapping, is in its infancy. We therefore set out\nto develop a series of tools that would assist in the profiling and analysis of\n1,952 publications on the theme of 'outcomes-based contracting'. Tools were\ndeveloped for the following tasks: assign publications into 'policy area'\ncategories; identify and extract key information for evidence mapping, such as\norganisations, laws, and geographical information; connect the evidence base to\nan existing dataset on the same topic; and identify subgroups of articles that\nmay share thematic content. An interactive tool using these techniques and a\npublic dataset with their outputs have been released. Our results demonstrate\nthe utility of ML techniques to enhance evidence accessibility and analysis\nwithin the systematic review processes. These efforts show promise in\npotentially yielding substantial efficiencies for future systematic reviewing\nand for broadening their analytical scope.

What method is\nchosen to handle missingness can greatly affect how models perform. In many\nreal-world problems, the best prediction performance is achieved by models that\ncan leverage the informative nature of a value being missing. Yet, the reasons\nwhy a covariate goes missing can change once a model is deployed in practice.\nIf such a missingness shift occurs, the conditional probability of a value\nbeing missing differs in the target data. Prediction performance in the source\ndata may no longer be a good selection criterion, and approaches that do not\nrely on informative missingness may be preferable. However, we show that the\nBayes predictor remains unchanged by ignorable shifts for which the probability\nof missingness only depends on observed data. Any consistent estimator of the\nBayes predictor may therefore result in robust prediction under those\nconditions, although we show empirically that different methods appear robust\nto different types of shifts. If the missingness shift is non-ignorable, the\nBayes predictor may change due to the shift. While neither approach recovers\nthe Bayes predictor in this case, we found empirically that disregarding\nmissingness was most beneficial when it was highly informative.\n","authors":["Patrick Rockenschaub","Zhicong Xian","Alireza Zamanian","Marta Piperno","Octavia-Andreea Ciora","Elisabeth Pachl","Narges Ahmidi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16484v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16481v1","updated":"2024-06-24T09:36:58Z","published":"2024-06-24T09:36:58Z","title":"Improving Quaternion Neural Networks with Quaternionic Activation\n  Functions","summary":"  In this paper, we propose novel quaternion activation functions where we\nmodify either the quaternion magnitude or the phase, as an alternative to the\ncommonly used split activation functions.

Catastrophic forgetting\n(of old tasks) has been identified as a major issue in CL, as the model adapts\nto new tasks. The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model has recently been shown to\neffectively mitigate catastrophic forgetting in CL, by employing a gating\nnetwork to sparsify and distribute diverse tasks among multiple experts.\nHowever, there is a lack of theoretical analysis of MoE and its impact on the\nlearning performance in CL. This paper provides the first theoretical results\nto characterize the impact of MoE in CL via the lens of overparameterized\nlinear regression tasks. We establish the benefit of MoE over a single expert\nby proving that the MoE model can diversify its experts to specialize in\ndifferent tasks, while its router learns to select the right expert for each\ntask and balance the loads across all experts. Our study further suggests an\nintriguing fact that the MoE in CL needs to terminate the update of the gating\nnetwork after sufficient training rounds to attain system convergence, which is\nnot needed in the existing MoE studies that do not consider the continual task\narrival. Furthermore, we provide explicit expressions for the expected\nforgetting and overall generalization error to characterize the benefit of MoE\nin the learning performance in CL.

Thus, existing GNNs either\noverlook necessary symmetry, resulting in suboptimal representation ability, or\nimpose excessive equivariance, which fails to generalize to unobserved\nsymmetric dynamics. In this work, we propose a general Discrete Equivariant\nGraph Neural Network (DEGNN) that guarantees equivariance to a given discrete\npoint group. Specifically, we show that such discrete equivariant message\npassing could be constructed by transforming geometric features into\npermutation-invariant embeddings. Through relaxing continuous equivariant\nconstraints, DEGNN can employ more geometric feature combinations to\napproximate unobserved physical object interaction functions. Two\nimplementation approaches of DEGNN are proposed based on ranking or pooling\npermutation-invariant functions. We apply DEGNN to various physical dynamics,\nranging from particle, molecular, crowd to vehicle dynamics. In twenty\nscenarios, DEGNN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\napproaches. Moreover, we show that DEGNN is data efficient, learning with less\ndata, and can generalize across scenarios such as unobserved orientation.\n","authors":["Zinan Zheng","Yang Liu","Jia Li","Jianhua Yao","Yu Rong"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16295v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11235v2","updated":"2024-06-24T03:34:02Z","published":"2024-02-17T09:52:43Z","title":"ZeroG: Investigating Cross-dataset Zero-shot Transferability in Graphs","summary":"  With the development of foundation models such as large language models,\nzero-shot transfer learning has become increasingly significant. This is\nhighlighted by the generative capabilities of NLP models like GPT-4, and the\nretrieval-based approaches of CV models like CLIP, both of which effectively\nbridge the gap between seen and unseen data. In the realm of graph learning,\nthe continuous emergence of new graphs and the challenges of human labeling\nalso amplify the necessity for zero-shot transfer learning, driving the\nexploration of approaches that can generalize across diverse graph data without\nnecessitating dataset-specific and label-specific fine-tuning. In this study,\nwe extend such paradigms to zero-shot transferability in graphs by introducing\nZeroG, a new framework tailored to enable cross-dataset generalization.\nAddressing the inherent challenges such as feature misalignment, mismatched\nlabel spaces, and negative transfer, we leverage a language model to encode\nboth node attributes and class semantics, ensuring consistent feature\ndimensions across datasets. We also propose a prompt-based subgraph sampling\nmodule that enriches the semantic information and structure information of\nextracted subgraphs using prompting nodes and neighborhood aggregation,\nrespectively. We further adopt a lightweight fine-tuning strategy that reduces\nthe risk of overfitting and maintains the zero-shot learning efficacy of the\nlanguage model.

To comprehensively\nassess the impact of road network properties on the performance of an ADF,\nvarying parameters such as intersection angle, curvature and lane width is\nessential. However, covering all potential scenarios is impractical,\nnecessitating the identification of feasible parameter ranges and automated\ngeneration of corresponding road networks for simulation. Automating the\nworkflow of road network generation, parameter variation, simulation, and\nevaluation leads to a comprehensive understanding of an ADF's behavior in\ndiverse road network conditions.

While the\nmulti-task learning literature already contains a variety of aggregators, they\noften lack some natural properties. In particular, the update should not\nconflict with any objective and should scale proportionally to the norm of each\ngradient.

Most notably, we introduce instance-wise risk minimization\n(IWRM), a learning paradigm in which the loss of each training example is\nconsidered a separate objective. On simple image classification tasks, IWRM\nexhibits promising results compared to the direct minimization of the average\nloss.

YOLO Phantom utilizes the novel Phantom Convolution block,\nachieving comparable accuracy to the latest YOLOv8n model while simultaneously\nreducing both parameters and model size by 43\\%, resulting in a significant\n19\\% reduction in Giga Floating-Point Operations (GFLOPs). YOLO Phantom\nleverages transfer learning on our multimodal RGB-infrared dataset to address\nlow-light and occlusion issues, equipping it with robust vision under adverse\nconditions. Its real-world efficacy is demonstrated on an IoT platform with\nadvanced low-light and RGB cameras, seamlessly connecting to an AWS-based\nnotification endpoint for efficient real-time object detection. Benchmarks\nreveal a substantial boost of 17\\% and 14\\% in frames per second (FPS) for\nthermal and RGB detection, respectively, compared to the baseline YOLOv8n\nmodel.

Despite the merits of\nprevious automatic bronchus segmentation methods, they have paied less\nattention to the issue we term as \\textit{Intensity Confusion}, wherein the\nintensity values of certain background voxels approach those of the foreground\nvoxels within bronchi. Conversely, the intensity values of some foreground\nvoxels are nearly identical to those of background voxels. This proximity in\nintensity values introduces significant challenges to neural network\nmethodologies. To address the issue, we introduce a novel Intensity-Distance\nGuided loss function, which assigns adaptive weights to different image voxels\nfor mining hard samples that cause the intensity confusion. The proposed loss\nestimates the voxel-level hardness of samples, on the basis of the following\nintensity and distance priors. We regard a voxel as a hard sample if it is in:\n(1) the background and has an intensity value close to the bronchus region; (2)\nthe bronchus region and is of higher intensity than most voxels inside the\nbronchus; (3) the background region and at a short distance from the bronchus.\nExtensive experiments not only show the superiority of our method compared with\nthe state-of-the-art methods, but also verify that tackling the intensity\nconfusion issue helps to significantly improve bronchus segmentation.

Gadolinium-based contrast agents, as\nthe most commonly used contrast agents, are expensive and may have potential\nside effects, and it is desired to obtain contrast-enhanced brain tumor MRI\nscans without the actual use of contrast agents. Deep learning methods have\nbeen applied to synthesize virtual contrast-enhanced MRI scans from\nnon-contrast images. However, as this synthesis problem is inherently\nill-posed, these methods fall short in producing high-quality results. In this\nwork, we propose Conditional Autoregressive Vision Model (CAVM) for improving\nthe synthesis of contrast-enhanced brain tumor MRI. As the enhancement of image\nintensity grows with a higher dose of contrast agents, we assume that it is\nless challenging to synthesize a virtual image with a lower dose, where the\ndifference between the contrast-enhanced and non-contrast images is smaller.\nThus, CAVM gradually increases the contrast agent dosage and produces\nhigher-dose images based on previous lower-dose ones until the final desired\ndose is achieved. Inspired by the resemblance between the gradual dose increase\nand the Chain-of-Thought approach in natural language processing, CAVM uses an\nautoregressive strategy with a decomposition tokenizer and a decoder.\nSpecifically, the tokenizer is applied to obtain a more compact image\nrepresentation for computational efficiency, and it decomposes the image into\ndose-variant and dose-invariant tokens. Then, a masked self-attention mechanism\nis developed for autoregression that gradually increases the dose of the\nvirtual image based on the dose-variant tokens. Finally, the updated\ndose-variant tokens corresponding to the desired dose are decoded together with\ndose-invariant tokens to produce the final contrast-enhanced MRI.\n","authors":["Lujun Gui","Chuyang Ye","Tianyi Yan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.16074v1.pdf","comment":"The work has been accepted by MICCAI 2024"}],"Robotics":[{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05080v2","updated":"2024-06-23T22:58:46Z","published":"2024-06-07T16:52:57Z","title":"I2EDL: Interactive Instruction Error Detection and Localization","summary":"  In the Vision-and-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE)\ntask, the human user guides an autonomous agent to reach a target goal via a\nseries of low-level actions following a textual instruction in natural\nlanguage.

To create more realistic\nadversarial attacks, we introduce a novel method that involves injecting\ntraitor agents into the CMARL system.

In this paper, we find that the DiTs typically exhibit\nconsiderable variance in terms of both weight and activation, which easily runs\nout of the limited numerical representations. To address this issue, we devise\nQ-DiT, which seamlessly integrates three techniques: fine-grained quantization\nto manage substantial variance across input channels of weights and\nactivations, an automatic search strategy to optimize the quantization\ngranularity and mitigate redundancies, and dynamic activation quantization to\ncapture the activation changes across timesteps.

To fill\nthe gap, we present an end-to-end general-purpose any-to-any MM-LLM system,\nNExT-GPT. We connect an LLM with multimodal adaptors and different diffusion\ndecoders, enabling NExT-GPT to perceive inputs and generate outputs in\narbitrary combinations of text, images, videos, and audio. By leveraging the\nexisting well-trained highly-performing encoders and decoders, NExT-GPT is\ntuned with only a small amount of parameter (1%) of certain projection layers,\nwhich not only benefits low-cost training and also facilitates convenient\nexpansion to more potential modalities.

However, existing\nresearch has shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In the\nphysical world, an adversary could exploit adversarial patches to implement a\nHiding Attack (HA) which patches the target object to make it disappear from\nthe detector, and an Appearing Attack (AA) which fools the detector into\nmisclassifying the patch as a specific object. Recently, many defense methods\nfor detectors have been proposed to mitigate the potential threats of\nadversarial patches. However, such methods still have limitations in\ngeneralization, robustness and efficiency. Most defenses are only effective\nagainst the HA, leaving the detector vulnerable to the AA.\n  In this paper, we propose \\textit{NutNet}, an innovative model for detecting\nadversarial patches, with high generalization, robustness and efficiency. With\nexperiments for six detectors including YOLOv2-v4, SSD, Faster RCNN and DETR on\nboth digital and physical domains, the results show that our proposed method\ncan effectively defend against both the HA and AA, with only 0.4\\% sacrifice of\nthe clean performance. We compare NutNet with four baseline defense methods for\ndetectors, and our method exhibits an average defense performance that is over\n2.4 times and 4.7 times higher than existing approaches for HA and AA,\nrespectively.

Although achieving groundbreaking progress, such design has\ncertain drawbacks: 1) preceding subtasks require massive high-quality 3D\nannotations as supervision, posing a significant impediment to scaling the\ntraining data; 2) each submodule entails substantial computation overhead in\nboth training and inference.

In this study, we propose a\nLocal-to-Global Cross-modal Attention-aware Fusion (LoGoCAF) framework for\nHSI-X classification that jointly considers efficiency, accuracy, and\ngeneralizability. LoGoCAF adopts a pixel-to-pixel two-branch semantic\nsegmentation architecture to learn information from HSI and X modalities. The\npipeline of LoGoCAF consists of a local-to-global encoder and a lightweight\nmultilayer perceptron (MLP) decoder.

The\ncomputer vision community established benchmarks such as ImageNet-C as a\nfundamental prerequisite to measure progress towards those challenges.

We simulate task and modality-specific image corruptions of varying\nseverity to comprehensively evaluate the robustness of established algorithms\nagainst real-world artifacts and distribution shifts.

Recent developments in transformer-based methods have\ndemonstrated enhanced performance in this domain. However, the standard\nattention mechanism utilized in these methods often integrates many\nlow-relevance points, thereby struggling to prioritize its attention weights on\nsparse yet meaningful points. This inefficiency leads to limited local\nstructure modeling capabilities and quadratic computational complexity. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the Point Tree Transformer (PTT), a\nnovel transformer-based approach for point cloud registration that efficiently\nextracts comprehensive local and global features while maintaining linear\ncomputational complexity. The PTT constructs hierarchical feature trees from\npoint clouds in a coarse-to-dense manner, and introduces a novel Point Tree\nAttention (PTA) mechanism, which follows the tree structure to facilitate the\nprogressive convergence of attended regions towards salient points.\nSpecifically, each tree layer selectively identifies a subset of key points\nwith the highest attention scores. Subsequent layers focus attention on areas\nof significant relevance, derived from the child points of the selected point\nset. The feature extraction process additionally incorporates coarse point\nfeatures that capture high-level semantic information, thus facilitating local\nstructure modeling and the progressive integration of multiscale information.\nConsequently, PTA empowers the model to concentrate on crucial local structures\nand derive detailed local information while maintaining linear computational\ncomplexity.

Deep learning-based methods have achieved\npromising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs\nusing convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task\nlearning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change\ndetection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning\nmethods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation\noutputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change\ndetection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a\nsatellite image time series. Specifically, we propose a temporal feature\nrefinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based\nmulti-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task\nintegration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal\nbuilding map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The\nproposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution\nsatellite image time series acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score\n0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440).

This\nstudy validates the SynthSeg robust brain segmentation model on computed\ntomography (CT), using a multi-center dataset.

Brain\nregions that failed to meet performance criteria were excluded based on\nautomated quality control (QC) scores. Dice scores indicate a median overlap of\n0.76 (IQR: 0.65-0.83).

In contrast, semantic images with intricate shapes have a\nwealth of high-level features, making them more resilient to countermeasures\nand potential for producing robust unlearnable examples. In this paper, we\npropose a Deep Hiding (DH) scheme that adaptively hides semantic images\nenriched with high-level features. We employ an Invertible Neural Network (INN)\nto invisibly integrate predefined images, inherently hiding them with deceptive\nperturbations.

However, we have observed\nthe existing PTQ frameworks exclusively designed for both ViT and conventional\nDiffusion models fall into biased quantization and result in remarkable\nperformance degradation. In this paper, we find that the DiTs typically exhibit\nconsiderable variance in terms of both weight and activation, which easily runs\nout of the limited numerical representations. To address this issue, we devise\nQ-DiT, which seamlessly integrates three techniques: fine-grained quantization\nto manage substantial variance across input channels of weights and\nactivations, an automatic search strategy to optimize the quantization\ngranularity and mitigate redundancies, and dynamic activation quantization to\ncapture the activation changes across timesteps. Extensive experiments on the\nImageNet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Q-DiT.\nSpecifically, when quantizing DiT-XL/2 to W8A8 on ImageNet 256x256, Q-DiT\nachieves a remarkable reduction in FID by 1.26 compared to the baseline.

Recently, some defense\nmechanisms have been proposed such as adversarial training, image\ntransformation techniques, and image purification. However, these schemes are\neither susceptible to adaptive attacks, built on unrealistic assumptions, or\nonly effective against specific poison types, limiting their universal\napplicability. In this research, we propose a more universally effective,\npractical, and robust defense scheme called ECLIPSE. We first investigate the\nimpact of Gaussian noise on the poisons and theoretically prove that any kind\nof poison will be largely assimilated when imposing sufficient random noise. In\nlight of this, we assume the victim has access to an extremely limited number\nof clean images (a more practical scene) and subsequently enlarge this sparse\nset for training a denoising probabilistic model (a universal denoising tool).\nWe then begin by introducing Gaussian noise to absorb the poisons and then\napply the model for denoising, resulting in a roughly purified dataset.\nFinally, to address the trade-off of the inconsistency in the assimilation\nsensitivity of different poisons by Gaussian noise, we propose a lightweight\ncorruption compensation module to effectively eliminate residual poisons,\nproviding a more universal defense approach.

Existing methods\noften suffer from inadequate training annotations, i.e., the sentence typically\nmatches with a fraction of the prominent video content in the foreground with\nlimited wording diversity. This intrinsic modality imbalance leaves a\nconsiderable portion of visual information remaining unaligned with text. It\nconfines the cross-modal alignment knowledge within the scope of a limited text\ncorpus, thereby leading to sub-optimal visual-textual modeling and poor\ngeneralizability. By leveraging the visual-textual understanding capability of\nmulti-modal large language models (MLLM), in this work, we take an MLLM as a\nvideo narrator to generate plausible textual descriptions of the video, thereby\nmitigating the modality imbalance and boosting the temporal localization. To\neffectively maintain temporal sensibility for localization, we design to get\ntext narratives for each certain video timestamp and construct a structured\ntext paragraph with time information, which is temporally aligned with the\nvisual content. Then we perform cross-modal feature merging between the\ntemporal-aware narratives and corresponding video temporal features to produce\nsemantic-enhanced video representation sequences for query localization.\nSubsequently, we introduce a uni-modal narrative-query matching mechanism,\nwhich encourages the model to extract complementary information from contextual\ncohesive descriptions for improved retrieval.

Prior work in\nskill-based RL either requires expert supervision to define useful skills,\nwhich is hard to scale, or learns a skill-space from offline data with\nheuristics that limit the adaptability of the skills, making them difficult to\ntransfer during downstream RL.

It is therefore unsurprising that the practice of\nmachine learning is rife with considerably richer algorithmic techniques for\nsuccessfully controlling model capacity. Nevertheless, no such technique or\nprinciple has broken away from the pack to characterize optimal learning in\nthese more general settings.\n  The purpose of this work is to characterize the role of regularization in\nperhaps the simplest setting for which ERM fails: multiclass learning with\narbitrary label sets. Using one-inclusion graphs (OIGs), we exhibit optimal\nlearning algorithms that dovetail with tried-and-true algorithmic principles:\nOccam's Razor as embodied by structural risk minimization (SRM), the principle\nof maximum entropy, and Bayesian reasoning. Most notably, we introduce an\noptimal learner which relaxes structural risk minimization on two dimensions:\nit allows the regularization function to be \"local\" to datapoints, and uses an\nunsupervised learning stage to learn this regularizer at the outset.

In this paper, we propose a new approach\nnamed Light-weight End-to-End Graph Interest Network (EGIN) to effectively mine\nusers' search interests and tackle previous challenges. (i) EGIN utilizes query\nand item's correlation and sequential information from the search system to\nbuild a heterogeneous graph for better CTR prediction in e-commerce search.\n(ii) EGIN's graph embedding learning shares the same training input and is\njointly trained with CTR prediction, making the end-to-end framework effortless\nto deploy in large-scale search systems.

We analyze two aspects of post-alignment\ndistributional shift of LLM responses. First, we re-examine previously reported\nreductions in response diversity post-alignment. Our analysis suggests that an\napparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality\ncontrol and information aggregation. Alignment suppresses irrelevant and\nunhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer\nresponses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM,\nessentially presenting diverse information in a single response. Finding little\nevidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the\nopposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be\nrecovered from base models? Our second investigation shows this is not the case\nand the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without\nfine-tuning. A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic\nhints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as\nsimilar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are\nto each other. Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment\ntechniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base\nLLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment\nHypothesis.

We also extend this to the\nagnostic setting and obtain an algorithm with a $\\Delta$ multiplicative regret,\nand we show no deterministic algorithm can achieve $o(\\Delta)$ multiplicative\nregret.\n  Next, we study two randomized models based on whether the random choices are\nmade before or after agents respond, and show they exhibit fundamental\ndifferences. In the first model, at each round the learner deterministically\nchooses a probability distribution over classifiers inducing expected values on\neach vertex (probabilities of being classified as positive), which the\nstrategic agents respond to. We show that any learner in this model has to\nsuffer linear regret. On the other hand, in the second model, while the\nadversary who selects the next agent must respond to the learner's probability\ndistribution over classifiers, the agent then responds to the actual hypothesis\nclassifier drawn from this distribution. Surprisingly, we show this model is\nmore advantageous to the learner, and we design randomized algorithms that\nachieve sublinear regret bounds against both oblivious and adaptive\nadversaries.\n","authors":["Saba Ahmadi","Avrim Blum","Kunhe Yang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.12355v2.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17615v1","updated":"2024-06-25T15:01:39Z","published":"2024-06-25T15:01:39Z","title":"Aligning Programming Language and Natural Language: Exploring Design\n  Choices in Multi-Modal Transformer-Based Embedding for Bug Localization","summary":"  Bug localization refers to the identification of source code files which is\nin a programming language and also responsible for the unexpected behavior of\nsoftware using the bug report, which is a natural language.

Our method employs statistical verification\ntechniques, and has the key advantage of being able to flag specific inputs for\nwhich the DNN's output may be unreliable - so that they may be later inspected\nby a human expert. To achieve this, our method conducts a statistical analysis\nof the DNN's predictions for other, nearby inputs, in order to detect\ninconsistencies. This is in contrast to existing techniques, which typically\nattempt to certify the entire DNN, as opposed to individual outputs. Our method\nuses the DNN as a black-box, and makes no assumptions about its topology. We\nhope that this work constitutes another step towards integrating DNNs in\nsafety-critical applications - especially in the aerospace domain, where high\nstandards of quality and reliability are crucial.\n","authors":["Guy Katz","Natan Levy","Idan Refaeli","Raz Yerushalmi"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02283v3.pdf","comment":"This is a preprint version of a paper that will appear at 43rd\n  Digital Avionics Systems Conference (DASC 2024)"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17542v1","updated":"2024-06-25T13:29:14Z","published":"2024-06-25T13:29:14Z","title":"CDQuant: Accurate Post-training Weight Quantization of Large Pre-trained\n  Models using Greedy Coordinate Descent","summary":"  Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable\nperformance across diverse language tasks.

Previous works on\nadversarial attacks have primarily focused on white-box attacks that directly\nperturb the states or actions of victim agents, often in scenarios with a\nlimited number of attacks. However, gaining complete access to victim agents in\nreal-world environments is exceedingly difficult. To create more realistic\nadversarial attacks, we introduce a novel method that involves injecting\ntraitor agents into the CMARL system.

The neural network with a set of nine imaging\nproperty maps passes our systematic null test criteria, and is chosen as the\nfiducial treatment. Assuming the universality relation, we find $\\fnl =\n34^{+24(+50)}_{-44(-73)}$ at 68\\%(95\\%) confidence. We apply a series of\nrobustness tests (e.g., cuts on imaging, declination, or scales used) that show\nconsistency in the obtained constraints. We study how the regression method\nbiases the measured angular power-spectrum and degrades the $\\fnl$ constraining\npower. The use of the nine maps more than doubles the uncertainty compared to\nusing only the three primary maps in the regression. Our results thus motivate\nthe development of more efficient methods that avoid over-correction, protect\nlarge-scale clustering information, and preserve constraining power.\nAdditionally, our results encourage further studies of $\\fnl$ with DESI\nspectroscopic samples, where the inclusion of 3D clustering modes should help\nseparate imaging systematics and lessen the degradation in the $\\fnl$\nuncertainty.\n","authors":["Mehdi Rezaie","Ashley J.

The performance of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and KAN models with\nthe same network settings were evaluated and compared to the conventional\nmulti-pool Lorentzian fitting (MPLF) method in generating water and multiple\nCEST contrasts, including amide, relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE), and\nmagnetization transfer (MT).

This\nraises a critical question: to what extent are AV failures in simulation\nconsistent with data collected from real-world testing? As a result of the gap\nbetween simulated and real sensor data (sim-to-real gap), failures in\nsimulation can either be spurious (simulation- or simulator-specific issues) or\nrelevant (safety-critical AV system issues). One possible method for validating\nif simulated time series failures are consistent with real world time series\nsensor data could involve retrieving instances of the failure scenario from a\nreal-world time series dataset, in order to understand AV performance in these\nscenarios.

This inefficiency leads to limited local\nstructure modeling capabilities and quadratic computational complexity. To\novercome these limitations, we propose the Point Tree Transformer (PTT), a\nnovel transformer-based approach for point cloud registration that efficiently\nextracts comprehensive local and global features while maintaining linear\ncomputational complexity. The PTT constructs hierarchical feature trees from\npoint clouds in a coarse-to-dense manner, and introduces a novel Point Tree\nAttention (PTA) mechanism, which follows the tree structure to facilitate the\nprogressive convergence of attended regions towards salient points.\nSpecifically, each tree layer selectively identifies a subset of key points\nwith the highest attention scores. Subsequent layers focus attention on areas\nof significant relevance, derived from the child points of the selected point\nset. The feature extraction process additionally incorporates coarse point\nfeatures that capture high-level semantic information, thus facilitating local\nstructure modeling and the progressive integration of multiscale information.\nConsequently, PTA empowers the model to concentrate on crucial local structures\nand derive detailed local information while maintaining linear computational\ncomplexity.

First, we establish that margin\nconsistency is a necessary and sufficient condition to use a model's logit\nmargin as a score for identifying non-robust samples. Next, through\ncomprehensive empirical analysis of various robustly trained models on CIFAR10\nand CIFAR100 datasets, we show that they indicate strong margin consistency\nwith a strong correlation between their input space margins and the logit\nmargins.

One opinion, especially from some\nstartups working on LLMs, argues that an LLM with nearly unlimited context\nlength can realize AGI. However, they might be too optimistic about the\nlong-context capability of (existing) LLMs -- (1) Recent literature has shown\nthat their effective context length is significantly smaller than their claimed\ncontext length; and (2) Our reasoning-in-a-haystack experiments further\ndemonstrate that simultaneously finding the relevant information from a long\ncontext and conducting (simple) reasoning is nearly impossible. In this paper,\nwe envision a pathway from LLMs to AGI through the integration of\n\\emph{memory}. We believe that AGI should be a system where LLMs serve as core\nprocessors. In addition to raw data, the memory in this system would store a\nlarge number of important conclusions derived from reasoning processes.\nCompared with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that merely processing raw\ndata, this approach not only connects semantically related information closer,\nbut also simplifies complex inferences at the time of querying.

Building from a VSA\nmodel for scene analysis, described in our companion paper, we present a\nmodular neuromorphic algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on\ntwo-dimensional VO tasks. Specifically, the proposed algorithm stores and\nupdates a working memory of the presented visual environment. Based on this\nworking memory, a resonator network estimates the changing location and\norientation of the camera. We experimentally validate the neuromorphic\nVSA-based approach to VO with two benchmarks: one based on an event camera\ndataset and the other in a dynamic scene with a robotic task.\n","authors":["Alpha Renner","Lazar Supic","Andreea Danielescu","Giacomo Indiveri","E.

Yet, one major problem is the computational challenge of the\ninference procedure, involving a combinatorial search across object identities\nand poses. Here we propose a neuromorphic solution exploiting three key\nconcepts: (1) a computational framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures\n(VSA) with complex-valued vectors; (2) the design of Hierarchical Resonator\nNetworks (HRN) to factorize the non-commutative transforms translation and\nrotation in visual scenes; (3) the design of a multi-compartment spiking phasor\nneuron model for implementing complex-valued resonator networks on neuromorphic\nhardware. The VSA framework uses vector binding operations to form a generative\nimage model in which binding acts as the equivariant operation for geometric\ntransformations. A scene can, therefore, be described as a sum of vector\nproducts, which can then be efficiently factorized by a resonator network to\ninfer objects and their poses. The HRN features a partitioned architecture in\nwhich vector binding is equivariant for horizontal and vertical translation\nwithin one partition and for rotation and scaling within the other partition.\nThe spiking neuron model allows mapping the resonator network onto efficient\nand low-power neuromorphic hardware. Our approach is demonstrated on synthetic\nscenes composed of simple 2D shapes undergoing rigid geometric transformations\nand color changes. A companion paper demonstrates the same approach in\nreal-world application scenarios for machine vision and robotics.\n","authors":["Alpha Renner","Lazar Supic","Andreea Danielescu","Giacomo Indiveri","Bruno A.

Since\nrule-based reasoning is essential for acquiring systematic generalization\nability, we aim to explore exactly whether transformers use rule-based or\ncase-based reasoning for math problems. Through carefully designed intervention\nexperiments on five math tasks, we confirm that transformers are performing\ncase-based reasoning, no matter whether scratchpad is used, which aligns with\nthe previous observations that transformers use subgraph matching/shortcut\nlearning to reason. To mitigate such problems, we propose a Rule-Following\nFine-Tuning (RFFT) technique to teach transformers to perform rule-based\nreasoning.

Traditional CTR models convert the multi-field\ncategorical data into ID features via one-hot encoding, and extract the\ncollaborative signals among features. Such a paradigm suffers from the problem\nof semantic information loss. Another line of research explores the potential\nof pretrained language models (PLMs) for CTR prediction by converting input\ndata into textual sentences through hard prompt templates. Although semantic\nsignals are preserved, they generally fail to capture the collaborative\ninformation (e.g., feature interactions, pure ID features), not to mention the\nunacceptable inference overhead brought by the huge model size. In this paper,\nwe aim to model both the semantic knowledge and collaborative knowledge for\naccurate CTR estimation, and meanwhile address the inference inefficiency\nissue. To benefit from both worlds and close their gaps, we propose a novel\nmodel-agnostic framework (i.e., ClickPrompt), where we incorporate CTR models\nto generate interaction-aware soft prompts for PLMs. We design a\nprompt-augmented masked language modeling (PA-MLM) pretraining task, where PLM\nhas to recover the masked tokens based on the language context, as well as the\nsoft prompts generated by CTR model. The collaborative and semantic knowledge\nfrom ID and textual features would be explicitly aligned and interacted via the\nprompt interface.

We further enrich this collection with our curated OCR\nintensive and Set-of-Mark datasets, extending the diversity and generality. By\ntraining over different base LLMs including TinyLlama1.1B, InternLM2-7B,\nLLaMA2-13B, and Mixtral8x7B, we obtain a spectrum of MLLMs that vary in\nparameter size and multilingual capabilities.

LLMs are integrating more into\neveryday life, raising public concerns about their security vulnerabilities.\nConsequently, the security of large language models is becoming critically\nimportant. Currently, the techniques for attacking and defending against LLMs\nare continuously evolving. One significant method type of attack is the\njailbreak attack, which designed to evade model safety mechanisms and induce\nthe generation of inappropriate content. Existing jailbreak attacks primarily\nrely on crafting inducement prompts for direct jailbreaks, which are less\neffective against large models with robust filtering and high comprehension\nabilities.

This is\narguably achieved by incorporating (i) 3D/2.5D shape perception from a single\nimage, (ii) render-and-compare simulation, and (iii) rich semantic cue\nawareness to furnish (coarse) reference-query correspondence. Existing methods\nimplement (i) by a 3D CAD model or well-calibrated multiple images and (ii) by\ntraining a network on specific objects, which necessitate laborious\nground-truth labeling and tedious training, potentially leading to challenges\nin generalization. Moreover, (iii) was less exploited in the paradigm of (ii),\ndespite that the coarse correspondence from (iii) enhances the compare process\nby filtering out non-overlapped parts under substantial pose\ndifferences/occlusions. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D generalizable\nrelative pose estimation method by elaborating (i) with a 2.5D shape from an\nRGB-D reference, (ii) with an off-the-shelf differentiable renderer, and (iii)\nwith semantic cues from a pretrained model like DINOv2. Specifically, our\ndifferentiable renderer takes the 2.5D rotatable mesh textured by the RGB and\nthe semantic maps (obtained by DINOv2 from the RGB input), then renders new RGB\nand semantic maps (with back-surface culling) under a novel rotated view. The\nrefinement loss comes from comparing the rendered RGB and semantic maps with\nthe query ones, back-propagating the gradients through the differentiable\nrenderer to refine the 3D relative pose.

While detecting\nsuch cases may be critical, evaluating a model's vulnerability at a\nper-instance level using adversarial attacks is computationally too intensive\nand unsuitable for real-time deployment scenarios. The input space margin is\nthe exact score to detect non-robust samples and is intractable for deep neural\nnetworks. This paper introduces the concept of margin consistency -- a property\nthat links the input space margins and the logit margins in robust models --\nfor efficient detection of vulnerable samples. First, we establish that margin\nconsistency is a necessary and sufficient condition to use a model's logit\nmargin as a score for identifying non-robust samples. Next, through\ncomprehensive empirical analysis of various robustly trained models on CIFAR10\nand CIFAR100 datasets, we show that they indicate strong margin consistency\nwith a strong correlation between their input space margins and the logit\nmargins. Then, we show that we can effectively use the logit margin to\nconfidently detect brittle decisions with such models and accurately estimate\nrobust accuracy on an arbitrarily large test set by estimating the input\nmargins only on a small subset.

It\nis particularly impressive when it comes to transferring style from a painting\nto an image. NST was originally achieved by solving an optimization problem to\nmatch the global statistics of the style image while preserving the local\ngeometric features of the content image. The two main drawbacks of this\noriginal approach is that it is computationally expensive and that the\nresolution of the output images is limited by high GPU memory requirements.\nMany solutions have been proposed to both accelerate NST and produce images\nwith larger size. However, our investigation shows that these accelerated\nmethods all compromise the quality of the produced images in the context of\npainting style transfer. Indeed, transferring the style of a painting is a\ncomplex task involving features at different scales, from the color palette and\ncompositional style to the fine brushstrokes and texture of the canvas. This\npaper provides a solution to solve the original global optimization for\nultra-high resolution (UHR) images, enabling multiscale NST at unprecedented\nimage sizes. This is achieved by spatially localizing the computation of each\nforward and backward passes through the VGG network. Extensive qualitative and\nquantitative comparisons, as well as a \\textcolor{coverletter}{perceptual\nstudy}, show that our method produces style transfer of unmatched quality for\nsuch high-resolution painting styles.

Nevertheless, vanilla self-attention,\nwhich serves as the core module of the transformer, calculates a weighted\naverage over all time steps; therefore, the local temporal semantics of sign\nvideos may not be fully exploited. In this study, we introduce a novel module\nin sign language recognition studies, called intra-inter gloss attention\nmodule, to leverage the relationships among frames within glosses and the\nsemantic and grammatical dependencies between glosses in the video. In the\nintra-gloss attention module, the video is divided into equally sized chunks\nand a self-attention mechanism is applied within each chunk. This localized\nself-attention significantly reduces complexity and eliminates noise introduced\nby considering non-relative frames. In the inter-gloss attention module, we\nfirst aggregate the chunk-level features within each gloss chunk by average\npooling along the temporal dimension. Subsequently, multi-head self-attention\nis applied to all chunk-level features.

The key issue of such a\nsegmentation problem lies in the effective integration of complementary\ninformation from PET and CT images. However, the quality of PET and CT images\nvaries widely in clinical settings, which leads to uncertainty in the modality\ninformation extracted by networks. To take the uncertainty into account in\nmulti-modal information fusion, this paper proposes a novel Multi-modal\nEvidential Fusion Network (MEFN) comprising a Cross-Modal Feature Learning\n(CFL) module and a Multi-modal Trusted Fusion (MTF) module. The CFL module\nreduces the domain gap upon modality conversion and highlights common tumor\nfeatures, thereby alleviating the needs of the segmentation module to handle\nmodality specificity. The MTF module utilizes mutual attention mechanisms and\nan uncertainty calibrator to fuse modality features based on modality\nuncertainty and then fuse the segmentation results under the guidance of\nDempster-Shafer Theory. Besides, a new uncertainty perceptual loss is\nintroduced to force the model focusing on uncertain features and hence improve\nits ability to extract trusted modality information.

This study aims to predict Amyloid Positron Emission\nTomography (AmyloidPET) status with multimodal retinal imaging and\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and to improve the performance through\npretraining with synthetic data. Methods. Fundus autofluorescence, optical\ncoherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography images from 328 eyes of 59\nAmyloidPET positive subjects and 108 AmyloidPET negative subjects were used for\nclassification. Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) were trained\nto generate synthetic images and unimodal CNNs were pretrained on synthetic\ndata and finetuned on real data or trained solely on real data. Multimodal\nclassifiers were developed to combine predictions of the four unimodal CNNs\nwith patient metadata.

Recently, the Mamba architecture, based\non state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural\nlanguage processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the\nshortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the\nfirst time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks.\nWe tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and\nMambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD),\nand building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt\nthe cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full\nlearning of global spatial contextual information from the input images.

To address these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel explicit 3D representation-video Gaussian\nrepresentation -- that embeds a video into 3D Gaussians.

While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),\nparticularly UNet-like models, and recent Transformers have shown substantial\nprogress in image segmentation, our empirical findings reveal their poor\nperformance in segmenting the small medical objects and lesions concerned in\nthis paper. This limitation may be attributed to information loss during their\nencoding and decoding process. In response to this challenge, we propose a\nnovel model named EFCNet for small object segmentation in medical images. Our\nmodel incorporates two modules: the Cross-Stage Axial Attention Module (CSAA)\nand the Multi-Precision Supervision Module (MPS). These modules address\ninformation loss during encoding and decoding procedures, respectively.\nSpecifically, CSAA integrates features from all stages of the encoder to\nadaptively learn suitable information needed in different decoding stages,\nthereby reducing information loss in the encoder. On the other hand, MPS\nintroduces a novel multi-precision supervision mechanism to the decoder. This\nmechanism prioritizes attention to low-resolution features in the initial\nstages of the decoder, mitigating information loss caused by subsequent\nconvolution and sampling processes and enhancing the model's global perception.\nWe evaluate our model on two benchmark medical image datasets.

While point-based rasterization effectively reduces computational\ndemands for rendering, it often struggles to accurately reconstruct the\ngeometry of the target object, especially under strong lighting. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce a novel approach that combines octree-based\nimplicit surface representations with Gaussian splatting. Our method consists\nof four stages. Initially, it reconstructs a signed distance field (SDF) and a\nradiance field through volume rendering, encoding them in a low-resolution\noctree. The initial SDF represents the coarse geometry of the target object.\nSubsequently, it introduces 3D Gaussians as additional degrees of freedom,\nwhich are guided by the SDF. In the third stage, the optimized Gaussians\nfurther improve the accuracy of the SDF, allowing it to recover finer geometric\ndetails compared to the initial SDF obtained in the first stage. Finally, it\nadopts the refined SDF to further optimize the 3D Gaussians via splatting,\neliminating those that contribute little to visual appearance.

We show this\nleads to a prisoner's dilemma, where all parties are incentivized to launch\nattacks, but the collective effect degrades the LLM's outputs for everyone.

To take the uncertainty into account in\nmulti-modal information fusion, this paper proposes a novel Multi-modal\nEvidential Fusion Network (MEFN) comprising a Cross-Modal Feature Learning\n(CFL) module and a Multi-modal Trusted Fusion (MTF) module.

A promising approach is the use of\ngradient-based optimization algorithms, where gradients are estimated through\nquantum measurements. However, it is generally difficult to efficiently measure\ngradients in QNNs because the quantum state collapses upon measurement. In this\nwork, we prove a general trade-off between gradient measurement efficiency and\nexpressivity in a wide class of deep QNNs, elucidating the theoretical limits\nand possibilities of efficient gradient estimation. This trade-off implies that\na more expressive QNN requires a higher measurement cost in gradient\nestimation, whereas we can increase gradient measurement efficiency by reducing\nthe QNN expressivity to suit a given task.

Additionally, current methods allocate the same\ncomputational resources to recover each pixel of pathology image, leading to\nthe sub-optimal recovery issue due to the large variation of pathology image.\nIn this paper, we propose the first hierarchical reinforcement learning\nframework named Spatial-Temporal hierARchical Reinforcement Learning (STAR-RL),\nmainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in pathology image\nsuper-resolution problem. We reformulate the SR problem as a Markov decision\nprocess of interpretable operations and adopt the hierarchical recovery\nmechanism in patch level, to avoid sub-optimal recovery. Specifically, the\nhigher-level spatial manager is proposed to pick out the most corrupted patch\nfor the lower-level patch worker. Moreover, the higher-level temporal manager\nis advanced to evaluate the selected patch and determine whether the\noptimization should be stopped earlier, thereby avoiding the over-processed\nproblem. Under the guidance of spatial-temporal managers, the lower-level patch\nworker processes the selected patch with pixel-wise interpretable actions at\neach time step.

The recovered reward function captures the\nmotivation of the expert. Agents can imitate experts by following these reward\nfunctions in their environment, which is known as apprentice learning. However,\nthe agents may face environments different from the demonstrations, and\ntherefore, desire transferable reward functions. Classical reward learning\nmethods such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) or, equivalently,\nadversarial imitation learning (AIL), recover reward functions coupled with\ntraining dynamics, which are hard to be transferable. Previous\ndynamics-agnostic reward learning methods rely on assumptions such as that the\nreward function has to be state-only, restricting their applicability. In this\nwork, we present a dynamics-agnostic discriminator-ensemble reward learning\nmethod (DARL) within the AIL framework, capable of learning both state-action\nand state-only reward functions. DARL achieves this by decoupling the reward\nfunction from training dynamics, employing a dynamics-agnostic discriminator on\na latent space derived from the original state-action space. This latent space\nis optimized to minimize information on the dynamics. We moreover discover the\npolicy-dependency issue of the AIL framework that reduces the transferability.\nDARL represents the reward function as an ensemble of discriminators during\ntraining to eliminate policy dependencies.

In this work, we show that this\napproach leads to sub-optimal 3D features, both in terms of grounding accuracy,\nas well as segmentation crispness. To alleviate this, we propose a multi-view\nfeature fusion strategy that employs object-centric priors to eliminate\nuninformative views based on semantic information, and fuse features at\nobject-level via instance segmentation masks. To distill our object-centric 3D\nfeatures, we generate a large-scale synthetic multi-view dataset of cluttered\ntabletop scenes, spawning 15k scenes from over 3300 unique object instances,\nwhich we make publicly available.

With this goal in mind, this\npaper critiques the standard formulation of the model editing problem and\nproposes a formal testbed for model editing research. We first describe 12 open\nproblems with model editing, based on challenges with (1) defining the problem,\n(2) developing benchmarks, and (3) assuming LLMs have editable beliefs in the\nfirst place.

However, most current methods\ncomplete the data collection and training steps in a single round, which may\noverlook the continuously improving ability of self-aligned models. This gives\nrise to a key query: What if we do multi-time bootstrapping self-alignment?\nDoes this strategy enhance model performance or lead to rapid degradation? In\nthis paper, our pioneering exploration delves into the impact of bootstrapping\nself-alignment on large language models. Our findings reveal that bootstrapping\nself-alignment markedly surpasses the single-round approach, by guaranteeing\ndata diversity from in-context learning. To further exploit the capabilities of\nbootstrapping, we investigate and adjust the training order of data, which\nyields improved performance of the model. Drawing on these findings, we propose\nStep-On-Feet Tuning (SOFT) which leverages model's continuously enhanced\nfew-shot ability to boost zero or one-shot performance.

We present AE-APT, a deep learning-based tool for APT detection\nthat features a family of AutoEncoder methods ranging from a basic one to a\nTransformer-based one. We evaluated our tool on a suite of provenance trace\ndatabases produced by the DARPA Transparent Computing program, where APT-like\nattacks constitute as little as 0.004% of the data. The datasets span multiple\noperating systems, including Android, Linux, BSD, and Windows, and cover two\nattack scenarios. The outcomes showed that AE-APT has significantly higher\ndetection rates compared to its competitors, indicating superior performance in\ndetecting and ranking anomalies.\n","authors":["Sidahmed Benabderrahmane","Ngoc Hoang","Petko Valtchev","James Cheney","Talal Rahwan"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19220v1.pdf","comment":"To appear Future Generation Computer Systems"},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19217v1","updated":"2024-06-27T14:43:50Z","published":"2024-06-27T14:43:50Z","title":"Think Step by Step: Chain-of-Gesture Prompting for Error Detection in\n  Robotic Surgical Videos","summary":"  Despite significant advancements in robotic systems and surgical data\nscience, ensuring safe and optimal execution in robot-assisted minimally\ninvasive surgery (RMIS) remains a complex challenge.

However, despite their considerable advantages over\ntraditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive\nmodels often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes\nand the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient\nemphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its\nglobal information within the frequency domain and the relationship between\ndifferent variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model\nFrequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into\ntrend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive\ndecomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH\nutilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal\nfeature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal\nglobal information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to\nhandle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves\ntheoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain\ntransformation method, effectively reducing computational costs. Extensive\nexperiments on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for\nshort-term forecasting demonstrate that FAITH outperforms existing models in\nmany fields, such as electricity, weather and traffic, proving its\neffectiveness and superiority both in long-term and short-term time series\nforecasting tasks.

Such characteristics are further exploited to craft\nprotective perturbation on sensitive images like portraits that prevent\nunauthorized generation.

In this paper, we take a\ncloser look at the fine-tuning process of personalized diffusion models through\nthe lens of shortcut learning and propose a hypothesis that could explain the\nunderlying manipulation mechanisms of existing perturbation methods.\nSpecifically, we find that the perturbed images are greatly shifted from their\noriginal paired prompt in the CLIP-based latent space. As a result, training\nwith this mismatched image-prompt pair creates a construction that causes the\nmodels to dump their out-of-distribution noisy patterns to the identifier, thus\ncausing serious performance degradation.

This survey provides an in-depth and\ncomprehensive inference of attacks and corresponding countermeasures in\nML-as-a-service based on taxonomy and the latest researches. Without\ncompromising researchers' intuition, we first propose the 3MP taxonomy based on\nthe community research status, trying to normalize the confusing naming system\nof inference attacks.

However, their\ntypical multi-step sequential-denoising nature gives rise to high cumulative\nlatency, thereby precluding the possibilities of parallel computation. To\naddress this, we introduce AsyncDiff, a universal and plug-and-play\nacceleration scheme that enables model parallelism across multiple devices. Our\napproach divides the cumbersome noise prediction model into multiple\ncomponents, assigning each to a different device. To break the dependency chain\nbetween these components, it transforms the conventional sequential denoising\ninto an asynchronous process by exploiting the high similarity between hidden\nstates in consecutive diffusion steps. Consequently, each component is\nfacilitated to compute in parallel on separate devices. The proposed strategy\nsignificantly reduces inference latency while minimally impacting the\ngenerative quality. Specifically, for the Stable Diffusion v2.1, AsyncDiff\nachieves a 2.7x speedup with negligible degradation and a 4.0x speedup with\nonly a slight reduction of 0.38 in CLIP Score, on four NVIDIA A5000 GPUs.

Although considerable results can be\nachieved in simple cases, however, the model performance may be limited by\nmonotonous modality expressions, sub-optimal fusion, and readout mechanisms. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel dual-stream framework for event stream-based\npattern recognition via differentiated fusion, termed EFV++. It models two\ncommon event representations simultaneously, i.e., event images and event\nvoxels. The spatial and three-dimensional stereo information can be learned\nseparately by utilizing Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN). We believe\nthe features of each representation still contain both efficient and redundant\nfeatures and a sub-optimal solution may be obtained if we directly fuse them\nwithout differentiation. Thus, we divide each feature into three levels and\nretain high-quality features, blend medium-quality features, and exchange\nlow-quality features.

Additionally, we implement a holistic\nself-training scheme that refines detection scores and coordinates through\nstep-wise entropy minimization and consistency-constraint regularization,\nensuring consistent predictions across stochastic augmentations of the same\nimage. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate that HUWSOD\ncompetes with state-of-the-art WSOD methods, eliminating the need for offline\nproposals and additional data.

Our findings also indicate that randomly\ninitialized boxes, although significantly different from well-designed offline\nobject proposals, are effective for WSOD training.\n","authors":["Liujuan Cao","Jianghang Lin","Zebo Hong","Yunhang Shen","Shaohui Lin","Chao Chen","Rongrong Ji"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19394v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19393v1","updated":"2024-06-27T17:59:46Z","published":"2024-06-27T17:59:46Z","title":"Looking 3D: Anomaly Detection with 2D-3D Alignment","summary":"  Automatic anomaly detection based on visual cues holds practical significance\nin various domains, such as manufacturing and product quality assessment.

This\ninefficiency is largely due to the self-attention heads capturing redundant\ntoken interactions, reflecting inherent redundancy within visual data. Many\nworks have aimed to reduce the computational complexity of self-attention in\nViTs, leading to the development of efficient and sparse transformer\narchitectures. In this paper, viewing through the efficiency lens, we realized\nthat introducing any sparse self-attention strategy in ViTs can keep the\ncomputational overhead low. However, these strategies are sub-optimal as they\noften fail to capture fine-grained visual details. This observation leads us to\npropose a general, efficient, sparse architecture, named Fibottention, for\napproximating self-attention with superlinear complexity that is built upon\nFibonacci sequences. The key strategies in Fibottention include: it excludes\nproximate tokens to reduce redundancy, employs structured sparsity by design to\ndecrease computational demands, and incorporates inception-like diversity\nacross attention heads. This diversity ensures the capture of complementary\ninformation through non-overlapping token interactions, optimizing both\nperformance and resource utilization in ViTs for visual representation\nlearning. We embed our Fibottention mechanism into multiple state-of-the-art\ntransformer architectures dedicated to visual tasks.

While many methods\nfocus on mitigating the issue of noisy pseudo-labels, they often overlook the\nunderlying data distribution p(pixel feature|class) in both the source and\ntarget domains. To address this limitation, we propose the multi-prototype\nGaussian-Mixture-based (ProtoGMM) model, which incorporates the GMM into\ncontrastive losses to perform guided contrastive learning. Contrastive losses\nare commonly executed in the literature using memory banks, which can lead to\nclass biases due to underrepresented classes. Furthermore, memory banks often\nhave fixed capacities, potentially restricting the model's ability to capture\ndiverse representations of the target/source domains. An alternative approach\nis to use global class prototypes (i.e. averaged features per category).\nHowever, the global prototypes are based on the unimodal distribution\nassumption per class, disregarding within-class variation. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the ProtoGMM model. This novel approach involves\nestimating the underlying multi-prototype source distribution by utilizing the\nGMM on the feature space of the source samples. The components of the GMM model\nact as representative prototypes. To achieve increased intra-class semantic\nsimilarity, decreased inter-class similarity, and domain alignment between the\nsource and target domains, we employ multi-prototype contrastive learning\nbetween source distribution and target samples.

Existing methods, however,\neither ignore the sparsity of Lidar features or fail to preserve the original\nspatial structure of LiDAR and the semantic density of camera features\nsimultaneously due to the modality gap. To address issues, this letter proposes\na novel bidirectional complementary Lidar-camera fusion framework, called\nBiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object\ndetection. The key insight is to mutually fuse the multi-modal features to\nenhance the semantics of LiDAR features and the spatial awareness of the camera\nfeatures and adaptatively select features from both modalities to build a\nunified 3D representation.

Although considerable results can be\nachieved in simple cases, however, the model performance may be limited by\nmonotonous modality expressions, sub-optimal fusion, and readout mechanisms. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel dual-stream framework for event stream-based\npattern recognition via differentiated fusion, termed EFV++. It models two\ncommon event representations simultaneously, i.e., event images and event\nvoxels. The spatial and three-dimensional stereo information can be learned\nseparately by utilizing Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN). We believe\nthe features of each representation still contain both efficient and redundant\nfeatures and a sub-optimal solution may be obtained if we directly fuse them\nwithout differentiation.

This paper empirically examines the\ngeneralizability of backdoor attacks during the instruction tuning of LVLMs for\nthe first time, revealing certain limitations of most backdoor strategies in\npractical scenarios. We quantitatively evaluate the generalizability of six\ntypical backdoor attacks on image caption benchmarks across multiple LVLMs,\nconsidering both visual and textual domain offsets. Our findings indicate that\nattack generalizability is positively correlated with the backdoor trigger's\nirrelevance to specific images/models and the preferential correlation of the\ntrigger pattern. Additionally, we modify existing backdoor attacks based on the\nabove key observations, demonstrating significant improvements in cross-domain\nscenario generalizability (+86% attack success rate). Notably, even without\naccess to the instruction datasets, a multimodal instruction set can be\nsuccessfully poisoned with a very low poisoning rate (0.2%), achieving an\nattack success rate of over 97%.

However, the evaluation of\nmost existing NVS methods relies on sporadic sampling of image frames from the\ntraining data, comparing the rendered images with ground truth images using\nmetrics. Unfortunately, this evaluation protocol falls short of meeting the\nactual requirements in closed-loop simulations.

To address this, this paper presents a novel driving\nview synthesis dataset and benchmark specifically designed for autonomous\ndriving simulations.

This challenge is compounded by the\nunknown camera movements and the lack of depth information of the scene. While\ndeep learning has shown impressive capabilities in addressing these issues,\nsupervised models require extensive training on massive annotated datasets, and\nunsupervised models also require training on large volumes of unannotated data,\npresenting significant barriers for both. In contrast, traditional methods\nbased on optical flow do not require training data, however, they often fail to\ncapture object-level information, leading to over-segmentation or\nunder-segmentation. In addition, they also struggle in complex scenes with\nsubstantial depth variations and non-rigid motion, due to the overreliance of\noptical flow. To overcome these challenges, we propose an innovative hybrid\napproach that leverages the advantages of both deep learning methods and\ntraditional optical flow based methods to perform dense motion segmentation\nwithout requiring any training.

Substituting the real-world data with synthetic data is therefore\nappealing for many machine learning applications that require large amounts of\ntraining data.

In many practical settings, the Wasserstein distance is\nan appropriate error metric for density estimation. For example, when\nestimating population densities in a geographic region, a small Wasserstein\ndistance means that the estimate is able to capture roughly where the\npopulation mass is. In this work we study differentially private density\nestimation in the Wasserstein distance. We design and analyze instance-optimal\nalgorithms for this problem that can adapt to easy instances.\n  For distributions $P$ over $\\mathbb{R}$, we consider a strong notion of\ninstance-optimality: an algorithm that uniformly achieves the instance-optimal\nestimation rate is competitive with an algorithm that is told that the\ndistribution is either $P$ or $Q_P$ for some distribution $Q_P$ whose\nprobability density function (pdf) is within a factor of 2 of the pdf of $P$.\nFor distributions over $\\mathbb{R}^2$, we use a different notion of instance\noptimality. We say that an algorithm is instance-optimal if it is competitive\nwith an algorithm that is given a constant-factor multiplicative approximation\nof the density of the distribution. We characterize the instance-optimal\nestimation rates in both these settings and show that they are uniformly\nachievable (up to polylogarithmic factors).

Existing PFL methods primarily adopt a parameter\npartitioning approach, where the parameters of a model are designated as one of\ntwo types: parameters shared with other clients to extract general knowledge\nand parameters retained locally to learn client-specific knowledge. However, as\nthese two types of parameters are put together like a jigsaw puzzle into a\nsingle model during the training process, each parameter may simultaneously\nabsorb both general and client-specific knowledge, thus struggling to separate\nthe two types of knowledge effectively. In this paper, we introduce FedDecomp,\na simple but effective PFL paradigm that employs parameter additive\ndecomposition to address this issue. Instead of assigning each parameter of a\nmodel as either a shared or personalized one, FedDecomp decomposes each\nparameter into the sum of two parameters: a shared one and a personalized one,\nthus achieving a more thorough decoupling of shared and personalized knowledge\ncompared to the parameter partitioning method.

These models\nmake predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes,\nfacilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct\ncalculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in\ngenerative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due\nto their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a\ndownstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However,\nevaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation\nused for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by\nGLLMs.\n  This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for\nevaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and\nclassification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a\ndrop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS\nscores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets, and more than 10 different GLLMs\ntogether with 3 different prompting methods using the ANLS* metric is also\nprovided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric.\n  We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called\nSFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN.

These methods are challenged by sparsity of\nhigh-fitness samples in the training set, a problem that has been in the\nliterature. A less recognized but equally important problem stems from the\ndistribution of training samples in the design space: leading methods are not\ndesigned for scenarios where the desired optimum is in a region that is not\nonly poorly represented in training data, but also relatively far from the\nhighly represented low-fitness regions. We show that this problem of\n\"separation\" in the design space is a significant bottleneck in existing\nmodel-based optimization tools and propose a new approach that uses a novel VAE\nas its search model to overcome the problem.

However, designing or evaluating such a cost\nfunction can be prohibitively expensive. For instance, in the domain of\nself-driving, designing a cost function that encompasses all unsafe behaviours\n(e.g. aggressive lane changes) is inherently complex. In such scenarios, the\ncost function can be learned from feedback collected offline in between\ntraining rounds. This feedback can be system generated or elicited from a human\nobserving the training process. Previous approaches have not been able to scale\nto complex environments and are constrained to receiving feedback at the state\nlevel which can be expensive to collect. To this end, we introduce an approach\nthat scales to more complex domains and extends to beyond state-level feedback,\nthus, reducing the burden on the evaluator. Inferring the cost function in such\nsettings poses challenges, particularly in assigning credit to individual\nstates based on trajectory-level feedback. To address this, we propose a\nsurrogate objective that transforms the problem into a state-level supervised\nclassification task with noisy labels, which can be solved efficiently.\nAdditionally, it is often infeasible to collect feedback on every trajectory\ngenerated by the agent, hence, two fundamental questions arise: (1) Which\ntrajectories should be presented to the human? and (2) How many trajectories\nare necessary for effective learning? To address these questions, we introduce\n\\textit{novelty-based sampling} that selectively involves the evaluator only\nwhen the the agent encounters a \\textit{novel} trajectory.

In this work, we present the study on the analysis of redundancy\nconcerning visual tokens and efficient training within these models. Our\ninitial experiments show that eliminating up to 70% of visual tokens at the\ntesting stage by simply average pooling only leads to a minimal 3% reduction in\nvisual question answering accuracy on the GQA benchmark, indicating significant\nredundancy in visual context. Addressing this, we introduce Visual Context\nCompressor, which reduces the number of visual tokens during training to\nenhance training efficiency without sacrificing performance. To minimize\ninformation loss caused by the compression on visual tokens while maintaining\ntraining efficiency, we develop LLaVolta as a lite training scheme. LLaVolta\nincorporates stage-wise visual context compression to progressively compress\nthe visual tokens from heavily to lightly, and finally no compression at the\nend of training, yielding no loss of information when testing.

The comparison\ninvolves three approaches: without (NR), with rigid (RR), and with rigid and\naffine (RAR) initializations. In addition to initialization, performances are\nevaluated in terms of accuracy, speed, and the impact of age intervals and sex\nper pair. Data consists of the publicly available MRI scans from the Calgary\nPreschool dataset, which includes 63 children aged 2-7 years, allowing for 431\nregistration pairs. We implemented the unsupervised DL framework with a U-Net\narchitecture using DeepReg and it was 5-fold cross-validated. Evaluation\nincludes Dice scores for tissue segmentation from 18 smaller regions obtained\nby SynthSeg, analysis of log Jacobian determinants, and registration pro-rated\ntraining and inference times. Learning-based approaches, with or without linear\ninitializations, exhibit slight superiority over SyN ANTs in terms of Dice\nscores. Indeed, DL-based implementations with RR and RAR initializations\nsignificantly outperform SyN ANTs. Both SyN ANTs and DL-based registration\ninvolve parameter optimization, but the choice between these methods depends on\nthe scale of registration: network-based for broader coverage or SyN ANTs for\nspecific structures. Both methods face challenges with larger age intervals due\nto greater growth changes. The main takeaway is that while DL-based methods\nshow promise with faster and more accurate registrations, SyN ANTs remains\nrobust and generalizable without the need for extensive training, highlighting\nthe importance of method selection based on specific registration needs in the\npediatric context.

Keypoint detectors, such as\nspatial autoencoders (SAEs), are a common approach to extracting a\nlow-dimensional representation from high-dimensional image data. SAEs aim at\nspatial features such as object positions, which are often useful\nrepresentations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is actually able to\ntrack objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation well\nsuited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established\nmetrics. In this paper, we propose to assess the performance of an SAE instance\nby measuring how well keypoints track ground truth objects in images.

To better understand these activities and\nbehaviors, it is crucial to model their dynamic interactions with the\nenvironment. The recent availability of affordable head-mounted cameras and\negocentric data offers a more accessible and efficient means to understand\ndynamic human-object interactions in 3D environments. However, most existing\nmethods for human activity modeling either focus on reconstructing 3D models of\nhand-object or human-scene interactions or on mapping 3D scenes, neglecting\ndynamic interactions with objects. The few existing solutions often require\ninputs from multiple sources, including multi-camera setups, depth-sensing\ncameras, or kinesthetic sensors. To this end, we introduce EgoGaussian, the\nfirst method capable of simultaneously reconstructing 3D scenes and dynamically\ntracking 3D object motion from RGB egocentric input alone. We leverage the\nuniquely discrete nature of Gaussian Splatting and segment dynamic interactions\nfrom the background. Our approach employs a clip-level online learning pipeline\nthat leverages the dynamic nature of human activities, allowing us to\nreconstruct the temporal evolution of the scene in chronological order and\ntrack rigid object motion. Additionally, our method automatically segments\nobject and background Gaussians, providing 3D representations for both static\nscenes and dynamic objects. EgoGaussian outperforms previous NeRF and Dynamic\nGaussian methods in challenging in-the-wild videos and we also qualitatively\ndemonstrate the high quality of the reconstructed models.\n","authors":["Daiwei Zhang","Gengyan Li","Jiajie Li","Micka√´l Bressieux","Otmar Hilliges","Marc Pollefeys","Luc Van Gool","Xi Wang"],"pdf_url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19811v1.pdf","comment":null},{"id":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19796v1","updated":"2024-06-28T10:05:58Z","published":"2024-06-28T10:05:58Z","title":"Comprehensive Generative Replay for Task-Incremental Segmentation with\n  Concurrent Appearance and Semantic Forgetting","summary":"  Generalist segmentation models are increasingly favored for diverse tasks\ninvolving various objects from different image sources.

However, the task evolution can span a wide scope that involves\nshifts in both image appearance and segmentation semantics with intricate\ncorrelation, causing concurrent appearance and semantic forgetting. To solve\nthis issue, we propose a Comprehensive Generative Replay (CGR) framework that\nrestores appearance and semantic knowledge by synthesizing image-mask pairs to\nmimic past task data, which focuses on two aspects: modeling image-mask\ncorrespondence and promoting scalability for diverse tasks.

This paper introduces a novel\nFKP recognition approach, the Dual-Order Texture Competition Network (DOTCNet),\ndesigned to capture texture information in FKP images comprehensively. DOTCNet\nincorporates three dual-order texture competitive modules (DTCMs), each\ntargeting textures at different scales.

By leveraging LGFs, the network extracts first and second order\ntextures to describe fine textures and structural features thoroughly.\nFurthermore, an attention mechanism enhances relevant features in the\nfirst-order features, thereby highlighting significant texture details. For\nsecond-order features, a competitive mechanism emphasizes structural\ninformation while reducing noise from higher-order features.

Examples of kernels include convolutions, transpositions, and\nvectorial products. There are many ways to implement a kernel. These\nimplementations form the kernel's optimization space. Kernel scheduling is the\nproblem of finding the best implementation, given an objective function --\ntypically execution speed. Kernel optimizers such as Ansor, Halide, and AutoTVM\nsolve this problem via search heuristics, which combine two phases: exploration\nand exploitation. The first step evaluates many different kernel optimization\nspaces. The latter tries to improve the best implementations by investigating a\nkernel within the same space. For example, Ansor combines kernel generation\nthrough sketches for exploration and leverages an evolutionary algorithm to\nexploit the best sketches. In this work, we demonstrate the potential to reduce\nAnsor's search time while enhancing kernel quality by incorporating Droplet\nSearch, an AutoTVM algorithm, into Ansor's exploration phase.

SAEs aim at\nspatial features such as object positions, which are often useful\nrepresentations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is actually able to\ntrack objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation well\nsuited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established\nmetrics.

Existing PFL methods primarily adopt a parameter\npartitioning approach, where the parameters of a model are designated as one of\ntwo types: parameters shared with other clients to extract general knowledge\nand parameters retained locally to learn client-specific knowledge. However, as\nthese two types of parameters are put together like a jigsaw puzzle into a\nsingle model during the training process, each parameter may simultaneously\nabsorb both general and client-specific knowledge, thus struggling to separate\nthe two types of knowledge effectively. In this paper, we introduce FedDecomp,\na simple but effective PFL paradigm that employs parameter additive\ndecomposition to address this issue. Instead of assigning each parameter of a\nmodel as either a shared or personalized one, FedDecomp decomposes each\nparameter into the sum of two parameters: a shared one and a personalized one,\nthus achieving a more thorough decoupling of shared and personalized knowledge\ncompared to the parameter partitioning method. In addition, as we find that\nretaining local knowledge of specific clients requires much lower model\ncapacity compared with general knowledge across all clients, we let the matrix\ncontaining personalized parameters be low rank during the training process.\nMoreover, a new alternating training strategy is proposed to further improve\nthe performance.

Recent advancements, as proposed by Zhu, Teo, and\nEnglert [Phys. Rev.

We find a variety of realistic noisy two-qubit\nquantum states $\\mathcal{F}$ that yield conclusive results under this witness\nfamily. We solve the problem of detecting entanglement among $K$ quantum states\nin $\\mathcal{F}$, of which $m$ states are entangled, with $m$ potentially\nunknown.

To do so, we introduce the EPOCH framework,\ncomprising two main components: the pose lifter network (LiftNet) and the pose\nregressor network (RegNet). LiftNet utilizes the full perspective camera model\nto precisely estimate the 3D pose in an unsupervised manner. It takes a 2D pose\nand camera parameters as inputs and produces the corresponding 3D pose\nestimation. These inputs are obtained from RegNet, which starts from a single\nimage and provides estimates for the 2D pose and camera parameters. RegNet\nutilizes only 2D pose data as weak supervision.

This tool is designed to simultaneously simplify the development of\ntask/cohorts for ML in healthcare and enable the reproduction of these cohorts,\nboth at an exact level for single datasets and at a conceptual level across\ndatasets.

Unlike language or image generation,\ndecision making requires modeling actions - continuous-valued vectors that are\nmultimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources,\nwhere generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class\nof models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing\nactions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means\nstruggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and\nlacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range\nactions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer\n(VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal\naction prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT\naugments BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector\nquantization module.

Sensitive information may not be explicit in the text, but\nhidden in underlying writing characteristics. Methods to protect privacy can\ninvolve using representations inside models that are demonstrated not to detect\nsensitive attributes or -- for instance, in cases where users might not trust a\nmodel, the sort of scenario of interest here -- changing the raw text before\nmodels can have access to it. The goal is to rewrite text to prevent someone\nfrom inferring a sensitive attribute (e.g. the gender of the author, or their\nlocation by the writing style) whilst keeping the text useful for its original\nintention (e.g. the sentiment of a product review). The few works tackling this\nhave focused on generative techniques. However, these often create extensively\ndifferent texts from the original ones or face problems such as mode collapse.\nThis paper explores a novel adaptation of adversarial attack techniques to\nmanipulate a text to deceive a classifier w.r.t one task (privacy) whilst\nkeeping the predictions of another classifier trained for another task\n(utility) unchanged.

The theoretical works that study NC are typically based on simplified\nunconstrained features models (UFMs) that mask any effect of the data on the\nextent of collapse. In this paper, we provide a kernel-based analysis that does\nnot suffer from this limitation. First, given a kernel function, we establish\nexpressions for the traces of the within- and between-class covariance matrices\nof the samples' features (and consequently an NC1 metric). Then, we turn to\nfocus on kernels associated with shallow NNs. First, we consider the NN\nGaussian Process kernel (NNGP), associated with the network at initialization,\nand the complement Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), associated with its training in\nthe \"lazy regime\". Interestingly, we show that the NTK does not represent more\ncollapsed features than the NNGP for prototypical data models. As NC emerges\nfrom training, we then consider an alternative to NTK: the recently proposed\nadaptive kernel, which generalizes NNGP to model the feature mapping learned\nfrom the training data.

Aggressive maneuvers have further required\ntask-specific tuning. Optimal control has the potential to mitigate these\nissues, but has to date only been demonstrated using approxiate models and\nreceding horizon controllers (RHC) that are too computationally demanding to be\ncarried out onboard the robot.

Keypoint detectors, such as\nspatial autoencoders (SAEs), are a common approach to extracting a\nlow-dimensional representation from high-dimensional image data. SAEs aim at\nspatial features such as object positions, which are often useful\nrepresentations in robotic RL. However, whether an SAE is actually able to\ntrack objects in the scene and thus yields a spatial state representation well\nsuited for RL tasks has rarely been examined due to a lack of established\nmetrics.

The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nhave demonstrated their exceptional abilities in solving complex mathematical\nproblems, mastering commonsense and abstract reasoning. This has led to the\nrecent utilization of MLLMs as the brain in robotic systems, enabling these\nmodels to conduct high-level planning prior to triggering low-level control\nactions for task execution. However, it remains uncertain whether existing\nMLLMs are reliable in serving the brain role of robots. In this study, we\nintroduce the first benchmark for evaluating Multimodal LLM for Robotic (MMRo)\nbenchmark, which tests the capability of MLLMs for robot applications.\nSpecifically, we identify four essential capabilities perception, task\nplanning, visual reasoning, and safety measurement that MLLMs must possess to\nqualify as the robot's central processing unit.

Unlike language or image generation,\ndecision making requires modeling actions - continuous-valued vectors that are\nmultimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources,\nwhere generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class\nof models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing\nactions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means\nstruggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and\nlacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range\nactions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer\n(VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal\naction prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations.
